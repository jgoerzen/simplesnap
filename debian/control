Description: Simple and powerful network transmission of ZFS snapshots
 simplesnap is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a net‚Äê
 work. Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal is
 to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup filesystem
 also running ZFS, using incremental backups to minimize network
 traffic and disk usage.
 .
 simplesnap it is designed to perfectly compliment
 snapshotting tools, permitting rotating backups with arbitrary
 retention periods. It lets multiple machines back up a single
 target, lets one machine back up multiple targets, and keeps it
 all straight.
 .
 simplesnap is easy; there is no configuration file needed. One
 ZFS property is available to exclude datasets/filesystems. ZFS
 datasets are automatically discovered on machines being backed
 up.
 .
 simplesnap  is robust in the face of interrupted
 transfers, and needs little help to keep running.
 .
 Unlike many similar tools, simplesnap does not
 require full root access to the machines being backed up. It
 runs only a small wrapper as root, and the wrapper has only three
 commands it implements.
