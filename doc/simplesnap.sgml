    <title>Description</title>


    <para>
      &simplesnap; is a simple way to send ZFS snapshots across a
      network.  Although it can serve many purposes, its primary goal
      is to manage backups from one ZFS filesystem to a backup
      filesystem also running ZFS, using incremental backups to
      minimize network traffic and disk usage.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>FLEXIBLE</emphasis>; it is designed to
      perfectly compliment snapshotting tools, permitting rotating
      backups with arbitrary retention periods.  It lets multiple
      machines back up a single target, lets one machine back up
      multiple targets, and keeps it all straight.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>EASY</emphasis>; there is no
      configuration file needed.  One ZFS property is available to
      exclude datasets/filesystems.  ZFS datasets are automatically
      discovered on machines being backed up.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>SAFE</emphasis>; it is robust in the
      face of interrupted transfers, and needs little help to keep
      running.
    </para>

    <para>
      &simplesnap; is <emphasis>SECURE</emphasis>; unlike many similar
      tools, it does not require full root access to the machines
      being backed up.  It runs only a small wrapper as root, and the
      wrapper has only three commands it implements.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Feature List</title>
      <para>
        Besides the above, &simplesnap;:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
            Does one thing and does it well.  It is designed to be used with
            a snapshot auto-rotator on both ends (such as zfSnap).  simplesnap
            will transfer snapshots made by other tools, but will not destroy
            them on either end.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Requires ssh public key authorization to the host being backed up,
            but does not require permission to run arbitrary commands.  It has
            a wrapper to run on the backup host, written in bash, which accepts
            only three operations and performs them simply.  It is suitable for
            a locked-down authorized_keys file.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Creates minimal snapshots for its own internal purposes, generally
            leaving no more than 1 or 2 per dataset, and reaps them
            automatically without touching others.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>
            Is a small program, easily audited.  In fact, most of the code is devoted to sanity-checking, security, and error
            checking.

        </listitem>

        <listitem><para>

      <title>Method of Operation</title>
      <para>
        &simplesnap;'s operation is very simple.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <command>simplesnap</command> program runs on the machine
        that stores the backups -- we'll call it the backuphost.
        There is a restricted remote command wrapper called
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> that runs on the machine
        being backed up -- we'll call it the activehost.
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> is never invoked directly by
        the end-user; it is always called remotely by
        <command>simplesnap</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
        With &simplesnap;, the backuphost always connects to the
        activehost -- never the other way round.
      </para>
      <para>
        <command>simplesnap</command> runs in the backuphost, and
        first connects to the <command>simplesnapwrap</command> on the
        activehost and asks it for a
        list of the ZFS datasets ("listfs" operation).  <command>simplesnapwrap</command>
        responds with a list of all ZFS datasets that were not flagged for
        exclusion.
      </para>

      <para>
        Next, <command>simplesnap</command> connects back to <command>simplesnapwrap</command> once for each dataset
        to be backed up -- the "sendback" operation.  <command>simplesnap</command> passes along
        to it only two things: the setname and the dataset
        (filesystem) name.
      </para>

      <para>
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> looks to see if there is an existing simplesnap
        snapshot corresponding to that <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>.  If not, it creates one and
        sends it as a full, non-incremental backup.  That completes the job
        for that dataset.
      </para>

      <para>
        If there is an existing snapshot for that <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>, simplesnapwrap
        creates a new one, constructing the snapshot name containing a
        timestamp and the <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>, then sends an incremental, using the oldest
        snapshot from that setname as the basis for zfs send -I.
      </para>

      <para>
        After the backuphost has observed <command>zfs receive</command> exiting without error,
        it contacts <command>simplesnapwrap</command> once more and requests the "reap"
        operation.  This cleans up the old snapshots for the given <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>,
        leaving only the most recent.  This is a separate operation in
        <command>simplesnapwrap</command> ensuring that even if the transmission is interrupted,
        still it will be OK in the end because <command>zfs receive -F</command> is used, and the
        data will come across next time.
      </para>

      <para>
        The idea is that some system like <command>zfSnap</command> will be used on both ends to
        make periodic snapshots and clean them up.  One can use careful prefix
        names with zfSnap to use different prefixes on each activehost, and
        then implement custom cleanup rules with -F on the holderhost.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Quick Start</title>

    <para>
      This section will describe how a first-time &simplesnap; user
      can get up and running quickly.  It assumes you already have
      &simplesnap; installed and working on your system.  If not,
      please follow the instructions in the
      <filename>INSTALL.txt</filename> file in the source
      distribution.
    </para>

    <para>
      As above, I will refer to the machine storing the backups as the
      "backuphost" and the machine being backed up as the
      "activehost".
    </para>
    <para>
      First, on the backuphost, as root, generate an ssh keypair that
      will be used exclusively for &simplesnap;.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap</command>
    </para>

    <para>
      When prompted for a passphrase, leave it empty.
    </para>

    <para>
      Now, on the activehost, edit or create a file called
      <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>.  Initialize it with the content of
      <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap.pub</filename> from the backuphost.  (Or, add to the
      end, if you already have lines in the file.)  Then, at the
      beginning of that one very long line, add text like this:
    </para>

    <programlisting><![CDATA[
command="/usr/sbin/simplesnapwrap",from="1.2.3.4",
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty 
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      (I broke that line into two for readability, but this must all
      be on a single line in your file.)
    </para>

    <para>
      The <replaceable>1.2.3.4</replaceable> is the IP address that
      connections from the backuphost
      will appear to come from.  It may be omitted if the IP is not static,
      but it affords a little extra security.  The line will wind up looking
      like:
    </para>

    <programlisting<![CDATA[
command="/usr/sbin/simplesnapwrap",from="1.2.3.4",
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAA....
]]></programlisting>

    <para>
      (Again, this should all be on one huge line.)
    </para>
    <para>
      If there are any ZFS datasets you do not want to be backed up, set
      <parameter>org.complete.simplesnap:exclude</parameter> property
      on the activehost
      to <parameter>on</parameter>.  For instance:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>zfs set org.complete.simplesnap:exclude=on
      tank/junkdata</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, back on the backuphost, you should be able to run:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap activehost</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      say yes when asked if you want to add the key to the known_hosts
      file.  At this point, you should see output containing:
    </para>
    <para>
      "simplesnapwrap: This program is to be run from ssh."
    </para>
    <para>
      If you see that, then simplesnapwrap was properly invoked
      remotely.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, create a ZFS filesystem to hold your backups.  For
      instance:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>zfs create tank/simplesnap</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      I often recommend compression for &simplesnap; datasets, so:
    </para>
    <para>
      <command>zfs set compression=lz4 tank/simplesnap</command>
    </para>
    <para>
      (If that gives an error, use compression=on instead.)
    </para>

    <para>
      Now, you can run the backup:
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>simplesnap --host activehost --setname mainset
        --store tank/simplesnap
        --sshcmd "ssh -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa_simplesnap"
      </command>
    </para>
    <para>
      You can monitor progress in <filename>/var/log/syslog</filename>.  If all goes well, you
      will see filesystems start to be populated under
      <filename>tank/simplesnap/host</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Simple!
    </para>

    <para>
      Now, go test that you have the data you expected to: look at
      your <replaceable>STORE</replaceable> filesystems and make sure
      they have everything expected.  Test repeatedly over time that
      you can restore as you expect from your backups.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Advanced: SETNAME usage</title>
    <para>
      Most people will always use the same <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable>.  The <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable> is used to
      track and name the snapshots on the remote end.  simplesnap tries to always
      leave one snapshot on the remote, to serve as the base for a future
      incremental.
    </para>

    <para>
      In some situations, you may have multiple bases for incrementals.  The
      two primary examples are two different backup servers backing up the
      same machine, or having two sets of backup media and rotating them to
      offsite storage.  In these situations, you will have to keep different
      snapshots on the activehost for the different backups, since they will
      be current to different points in time.
    </para>
  </refsect1>


  <refsect1>
    <title>Options</title>

    <para>
      All &simplesnap; options begin with two dashes (`--').  Most take
      a parameter, which is to be separated from the option by a
      space.  The equals sign is not a valid separator for
      &simplesnap;.
    </para>

    <para>
      The normal &simplesnap; mode is backing up.  An alternative
      check mode is available, which requires fewer parameters.  This
      mode is described below.
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--check <replaceable>TIMEFRAME</replaceable></option>
          <listitem><para>
            Do not back up, but check existing backups.  If any
            datasets' newest backup is older than
          <replaceable>TIMEFRAME</replaceable>, print an error and
            exit with a nonzero code.  Scans all hosts unless a
            specific host is given with <option>--host</option>.  The
            parameter is in the format given to GNU <application>date</application>(1); for
            instance,
            --check "30 days ago".  Remember to enclose it in quotes
            if it contains spaces.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--host</option>
        <replaceable>HOST</replaceable></term>
        <listitem><para>
            Gives the name of the host to back up.  This is both
            passed to ssh and used to name the backup sets.
          </para>
          <para>
            In a few situations, one may not wish to use the same name
            for both.  It is recommend to use the Host and HostName
            options in <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename> to configure aliases in this
            situation.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--local</option>
          <listitem><para>
            Specifies that the host being backed up is local to the
            machine.  Do not use ssh to contact it, and invoke the
            wrapper directly.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--only-dataset <replaceable>DATASET</replaceable></option>
          <listitem><para>
            Normally, &simplesnap; automatically obtains a list of
            datasets to back up from the remote, and backs up all of
            them except those that define the
            <parameter>org.complete.simplesnap:exclude=on</parameter>
            property.  With this option, &simplesnap; does not bother
            to ask the remote for a list of datasets, and instead
            backs up only the one precise
          <replaceable>DATASET</replaceable> given.

          <listitem><para>
            Gives the command to use to connect to the remote host.
            Defaults to "ssh".  It may be used to select an
            alternative configuration file or keypair.  Remember to
            quote it per your shell if it contains spaces.  For example: 
            --sshcmd "ssh -i /root/.id_rsa_simplesnap".  This command
            is ignored when <option>--local</option> or
            <option>--check</option> is given.

        <term><option>--setname <replaceable>SETNAME</replaceable></option></term>
        <listitem><para>
            Gives the backup set name.  Can just be a made-up word if
            multiple sets are not needed; for instance, the hostname of
            the backup server.  This is used as part of the snapshot
            name.

    <title>Backup Interrogation</title>

    <para>
      Since &simplesnap; stores backups in standard ZFS datasets, you

      <para>
        Here, you can see that the total size of the &simplesnap; data
        is 540G - the USED value from the top level.  In this example,
        host1 was using the most space -- 473G -- and host3 the least --
        12.2G.  There is 867G available on this zpool for backups.

      <para>
        I've trimmed the "mountpoint" column here so it doesn't get
        too wide for the screen.
      </para>
      <para>
        You see here the same 54.9G used as in the previous example,
        but now you can trace it down.  There were two zpools on
        host2: tank and rpool.  Most of the backup space -- 49.8G of
        the 54.9G -- is used by tank, and only 5.12G by rpool.  And in
        tank, 42.4G is used by vm.  Tracing it down, of that 42.4G
        used by vm, 32G is in vm1 and 10.4G in vm2.  Notice how the
        values at each level of the tree include their descendents.
      </para>
      <para>
        So in this example, vm1 and vm2 are zvols corresponding to
        virtual machines, and clearly take up a lot of space.  Notice
        how vm1 says it uses 32.0G but in the refer column, it only
        refers to 29.7G?  That means that the latest backup for vm2
        used 29.7G, but when you add in the snapshots for that
        dataset, the total space consumed is 32.0G.
      </para>
      <para>
        Let's look at an alternative view that will make the size
        consumed by snapshots more clear:

      <para>
        The AVAIL and USED columns are the same as before, but now you
        have a breakdown of what makes up the USED column.  USEDSNAP
        is the space used by the snapshots of that particular
        dataset.  USEDDS is the space used by that dataset directly --
        the same value as was in REFER before.  And USEDCHILD is the
        space used by descendents of that dataset.  
      </para>
      <para>
        The USEDSNAP column is the
        easiest way to see the impact your retention policies have on
        your backup space consumption.

      <title>Viewing snapshots of a dataset</title>
      <para>
        Let's take one example from
        before -- the 153M of snapshots in host2-1/var, and see what we
        can find.

      <para>
        In this output, the REFER column is the amount of data pointed
        to by that snapshot -- that is, the size of /var at the moment
        the snapshot is made.  And the USED column is the amount of
        space that would be freed if just that snapshot were deleted.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note this important point: it is normal for the sum of the
        values in the USED column to be less than the space consumed
        by the snapshots of the datasets as reported by USEDSNAP in
        the previous example.  The reason is that the USED column is
        the data unique to that one snapshot.  If, for instance, 100MB
        of data existed on the system being backed up for
        three hours yesterday, each snapshot could very well show less
        than 100KB used, because that 100MB isn't unique to a
        particular snapshot.  Until, that is, two of the three
        snapshots referncing the 100MB data are destroyed; then the
        USED value of the last one referencing it will suddenly jump
        to 100MB higher because now it references unique data.
      </para>
      <para>
        One other point -- an indication that the last backup was
        successfully transmitted is the presence of a
        __simplesnap_...__ snapshot at the end of the list.  Do not
        delete it.

        Any backup scheme should be tested carefully before being

      <para>
        In order to account for various situations that could lead to
        divergence of filesystems, including the simple act of mounting
        them, &simplesnap; always uses <command>zfs receive
          -F</command>.  Any local changes you make to the &simplesnap;
        store datasets will be lost at any time.  If you need to make
        local changes there, it is best to copy them elsewhere.

      <title>Extraneous Snapshot Buildup</title>
      <para>
        Since &simplesnap; sends all snapshots, it is possible that
        locally-created snapshots made outside of your rotation scheme
        will also be sent to your backuphost.  These may not be
        automatically reaped there, and may stick around.  An example
        at the end of the
        <filename>cron.daily.simplesnap.backuphost</filename> file
        included with &simplesnap; is one way to check for these.
        They could automatically be reaped with <command>zfs
        destroy</command> as well, but this must be carefully tuned to
        local requirements, so an example of doign that is
        intentionally not supplied with the distribution.

    <para>
      Ordinarily, an interrupted transfer is no problem for
      &simplesnap;.  However, the very first transfer of a dataset
      poses a bit of a problem, since the &simplesnap; wrapper can't
      detect failure in this one special case.  If your first transfer
      gets interrupted, simply zfs destroy the __simplesnap_...__
      snapshot on the activehost and rerun.  NEVER DESTROY
      __simplesnap SNAPSHOTS IN ANY OTHER SITUATION!
