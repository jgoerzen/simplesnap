PREREQUISITES

Requires:

 * GNU bash
 * logger (from bsdutils on Linux; 
   ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/ or 
   git://git.debian.org/~lamont/util-linux.git )

Highly recommended:

 * An automatic snapshotting and rotation system.  I use zfSnap from
   https://github.com/graudeejs/zfSnap

 * optional but recommended: dotlockfile from liblockfile.

This has been tested on Debian Linux with ZFSOnLinux.  It will
probably work on FreeBSD or Solaris as well, especially if the GNU
tools are installed or available under "g" names.  The script will try
to find them with those names and use them if possible.

  To install MacOS prerequisites using Homebrew (https://brew.sh):

   * brew install coreutils grep gnu-sed liblockfile


INSTALLATION

Copy simplesnap somewhere on the host that will store backups and mark
it executable.

Copy simplesnapwrap somewhere on the hosts that will be backed up and
mark it executable.

If the host storing backups will also be backed up, it needs both.
